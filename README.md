# ðŸ§  Python-Based Machine Learning Scripts (Jupyter Notebooks)

This repository contains a collection of machine learning scripts written in **Python** and executed using **Jupyter Notebooks** for local data analysis and modeling tasks. Each script demonstrates practical workflows for building, evaluating, and improving ML models across a variety of datasets.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The purpose of this repo is to:

- Explore real-world datasets using ML techniques.
- Build end-to-end ML pipelines.
- Practice with scikit-learn's tools for model training and evaluation.
- Apply standard preprocessing and data validation techniques.

All scripts are self-contained and designed to run locally on your machine using Jupyter.

## ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

> Additional libraries may be used depending on the specific script.


## ðŸ”„ Typical ML Workflow

Each notebook generally follows this structure:

1. **Import Libraries**  
   Essential Python and ML libraries are imported.

2. **Load Dataset**  
   Data is loaded using Pandas from local `.csv` files or external URLs.

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical data (if any)  
   - Scale features using `StandardScaler` or similar

4. **Train-Test Split**  
   Data is split (typically 70/30 or 80/20) for training and testing.

5. **Model Training**  
   ML models like `DecisionTreeClassifier`, `LogisticRegression`, or `RandomForestClassifier` are trained using `scikit-learn`.

6. **Model Evaluation**  
   Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix are calculated to assess performance.

7. **Visualization** *(if applicable)*  
   Matplotlib or Seaborn is used for EDA and visualizing model results.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-jupyter-scripts.git
cd ml-jupyter-scripts

### 2. Run the script in your anaconda jupyter notebook
